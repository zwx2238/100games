## Motivation

This project started as an experiment: **can AI agents build 100 unique, playable games in under 24 hours?**

Using [Claude Code](https://claude.ai) (Anthropic's AI coding agent), every game was designed, coded, and polished from a single prompt — each one a self-contained HTML5 canvas game with no external dependencies. The AI handled game mechanics, physics, sound design (Web Audio API oscillators), touch/mouse input, responsive sizing, and visual polish.

The result: 100 games spanning physics, puzzles, rhythm, strategy, word games, arcade action, and more — all built in a single session. No copy-paste templates. Each game has unique mechanics and its own personality.

**Tools used:**
- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai) — AI agent for code generation
- Vanilla JavaScript + HTML5 Canvas — no frameworks
- Web Audio API — synthesized sound effects, no audio files
- GitHub Pages — free hosting

## Project Structure

```

├── index.html              # Homepage — game gallery with live previews
├── play.html               # Game player with carousel and side menu

```

Each game is a **single `index.html` file** containing all HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No build step, no bundler, no external assets. Open any game file directly in a browser to play.

## Curated self-host catalog

`catalog.json` is a machine-readable inventory for source-based self-hosting.
It keeps all 100 upstream entries auditable while marking 95 games as selected.
The five excluded entries are `FIVE`, `SLOTS`, `KENO`, `ANTONYM`, and `BID`;
each entry records its curation reason. Every catalog item also includes a
browser-rendered preview image, category, input mode, language profile, and
license metadata.

### Run locally

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000
```

### Deploy

---

## Testing

The project includes two automated test suites powered by [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/).

### Prerequisites

```bash
npm install    # (no package.json needed — Playwright is used via npx)
npx playwright install chromium
```

### Test 1: Smoke Test (load + interaction)

Verifies all 100 games load without errors, render a canvas, and respond to a click.

```bash
npm run test:games
```

- Loads each game in a headless browser
- Checks for JS console errors, canvas presence, and non-zero dimensions
- Simulates a click and checks for errors after interaction
- Generates `scripts/test-report.html` with before/after screenshots

### Test 2: Gameplay + Responsive Test

Simulates 10 seconds of actual gameplay per game and tests rendering at 3 viewport sizes.

```bash
npm run test:gameplay
```

- Simulates realistic input: clicks, drags, keyboard events across the canvas
- Verifies the game animates (pixel change detection between before/after)
- Tests responsive rendering at 3 sizes:
  - **Mobile** — 375 × 667 (iPhone SE)
  - **Tablet** — 768 × 1024 (iPad)
  - **Desktop** — 1440 × 900
- Generates `scripts/test-gameplay-report.html` with 500 screenshots
